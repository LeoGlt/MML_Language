# Multi Machine Learning Language application

This application allows you to use Machine Learning algorithms to model your data.

You just need to specify your desired parameters and the application will generate the MML code, display the results, as well as the R/Python generated scripts. 

## Prerequisites and Installation

To get information on how to install the MML application and the required dependencies, please refer to install.md.

## Functionalities

### Algorithms
Available Machine Learning algorithms are:
  -Decision Tree
  -Support Vector Machines
  -Logistic Regression
  -Random Forest

### Frameworks
You may choose between two frameworks for your algorithm to be implemented in: scikit-learn (Python) and R.

### Validation method
Two validation methods are proposed: Train/Test split and Cross-validation.

### Outputs
Available metrics to be shown in the outputs:
  -Accuracy
  -Recall
  -Precision
  -F1
  -Balanced Accuracy

## Usage

You may first begin by uploading the .csv file containing the data you want to analyze.

You can then select the target variable and which variables you want to use to predict.

Then you must choose the Machine Learning algorithm and framework you want to use. Note that you can choose as many as you want.

The next step is to select the validation procedure, and the desired outputs. You can then compile to generate the MML code.

Finally, submitting will show you the outputs, and offer you the possibility to display the R/Python scripts.
